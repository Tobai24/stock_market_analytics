# stock_market_analytics

This repository tracks my progress as I explore the stock market, following the content of the DataTalksClub Stock Market Analytics course.

I'm mainly a medical student, but I love exploring things beyond medicine and investment is one of them! This is just me having fun learning how to analyze financial data and make sense of market trends.
